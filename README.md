This demo is just a raw implementation of portals, simple joints and basic physics using Box2D, and is developed with the awesome LibGDX java game framework: http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/

- Run Instruction:

Make sure you have jre6+ installed on your machine, then just run the PortalWorld.jar

- Android platform

Following LibGDX instructions on their website, you can easily make an Android project attached to this one.


- Gameplay Instructions and Commands

There's not a real goal in this test demo.
Your character is the red circle you see on screen.
Imagine that you're a sort of space ship, with limited fuel (which recharge automagically while you're not using it), and you can trigger movements clicking with the mouse near the circle and dragging the mouse outwards to lead the movement on that direction.
You can also double click to trigger an instant rush.
Also, while within the interactive range, the further the mouse is from the ball, the faster it moves.
When you're near little boxes (squares), if you click on them you can attach them to yourself, and travel around together.
The slim vertical rectangles are portals, anything that will go through them will be teleported on an exit portal on the same stage.

Have fun!
